Exercise 1: System Hardware Detective (15-20 minutes)

1.	My computer system is Windows 

2. Find and record the following:

⦁	Processor (CPU) brand, model, and number of cores:

Processor	13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1355U, 1700 Mhz, 10 Core(s), 12 Logical Processor(s)

⦁	Total RAM amount and type (DDR4/DDR5)

Manufacturer Part Number           Memory Type SMBIOS Memory Type
------------ ----------           ---------- ----------------
SK Hynix     HMAG66DXNSB097N               0               26

⦁	Storage device type (HDD/SSD) and capacity:

Type: Disk 0 (c:)
Capacity: 954GB

⦁	Operating System version:

OS Name	Microsoft Windows 11 Home
Version	10.0.26100 Build 26100

3. Analysis Questions:

⦁	Based on your CPU cores, how many tasks can your processor theoretically handle simultaneously?

10 Cores Physical Cores & 12 Logical Processors Logical Processors

⦁	Is your storage primarily HDD or SSD? What are the performance implications?

My storage is primarily SSD (Solid State Drive).

In my own opinion, SSD is more faster than HDD somehow, I google the reason - SSD makes computer faster and more responsive than if it used an HDD. Programs start quickly, files load faster, and overall system performance is smoother.

⦁	How does your RAM amount compare to typical requirements for modern applications?

My current student computer has 16 GB of RAM, I think for most of office working applications or basic computer games are enough to run with, I used to had Apple Mac Mini 2020 which only has 8 GB, I found it was total enough for my daily use as I was working as a travel agent.
