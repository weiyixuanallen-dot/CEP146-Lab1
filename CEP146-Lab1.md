## Exercise 1: System Hardware Detective (15-20 minutes)

### 1. My computer system
- Windows

### 2. Find and record the following:

**Processor (CPU) brand, model, and number of cores:**

| Processor | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| CPU       | 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1355U |
| Speed     | 1700 Mhz |
| Cores     | 10 Physical Cores |
| Logical Processors | 12 |

**Total RAM amount and type (DDR4/DDR5):**

| Manufacturer | Part Number | Memory Type | SMBIOS Memory Type |
|--------------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| SK Hynix     | HMAG66DXNSB097N | 0 | 26 |

**Storage device type (HDD/SSD) and capacity:**

- Type: Disk 0 (C:)  
- Capacity: 954 GB  

**Operating System version:**

| OS Name | Version |
|---------|---------|
| Microsoft Windows 11 Home | 10.0.26100 Build 26100 |

### 3. Analysis Questions:

**Q1: Based on your CPU cores, how many tasks can your processor theoretically handle simultaneously?**  
- 10 Physical Cores & 12 Logical Processors

**Q2: Is your storage primarily HDD or SSD? What are the performance implications?**  
- My storage is primarily SSD (Solid State Drive).  
- In my opinion, SSD is faster than HDD. According to my research, SSDs make computers faster and more responsive. Programs start quickly, files load faster, and overall system performance is smoother.

**Q3: How does your RAM amount compare to typical requirements for modern applications?**  
- My current student computer has 16 GB of RAM. For most office applications or basic computer games, this is sufficient. Previously, I used an Apple Mac Mini 2020 with only 8 GB of RAM, and it was enough for my daily use while working as a travel agent.
